# Privacy Policy for Catzy

**Last updated: March 29, 2025**

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Catzy ("we", "us", or "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our cat care and AI-powered app, Catzy ("the App"), and outlines your rights and choices regarding that data.

## 2. Important Information and Who We Are

Catzy is a mobile application that offers cat breed identification, AI-generated cat images, and other visual features. This Privacy Policy applies solely to data collected through the Catzy app.

## 3. The Data We Collect About You

We do not collect or store personal information unless explicitly shared by you. However, the App may process and store the following types of data:

- **Image Data**: Temporarily processed for breed identification, AI portraits, and similar features.
- **Camera Access**: The App may request permission to use your device’s camera to allow image capture.
- **Community Shared Images**: If you choose to share an image to the Catzy Community, that image will be stored on our servers for display within the app.
  
We do not collect names, emails, or other identifying information unless provided by you in future features.

## 4. How We Use Your Data

We use your data to:

- Provide the core functionality of the App (e.g., breed identification, AI portraits).
- Process images via third-party AI services to generate results.
- Display user-submitted images in the Community section, if you choose to share them.
  
We do **not** use your data for tracking, profiling, or advertising purposes.

## 5. Data Sharing and Transfers

Image data may be shared with third-party AI providers for real-time processing, including:

- [Google Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/legal/privacy-policy)
- [Replicate](https://replicate.com/privacy)

These services process images but do **not** store or reuse them.

Images voluntarily shared with the Catzy Community may be stored on our secure servers and visible to other users within the app. These are not shared with third parties or used for external marketing.

## 6. Data Retention

Catzy does **not** retain images used for breed identification or AI features—these are processed and discarded immediately after use.

However, if you **choose to share an image to the Catzy Community**, that image will be stored on our servers until you request its removal. You may contact us at **thepythontimes8@gmail.com** to delete any community-shared content.

We do not store any other personal data.

## 7. AI-Generated Insights Disclaimer

The results provided by Catzy are **AI-generated** and meant for informational or entertainment purposes. They are **not a substitute for professional veterinary advice**.

Always consult a licensed veterinarian regarding your cat’s health, diet, or behavior. Catzy is not liable for any consequences from relying on AI-generated content.

## 8. In-App Purchases

Catzy may offer premium features through in-app purchases. All transactions are handled by the App Store (Apple), and we do **not** collect or store your payment data. Refer to Apple’s Privacy Policy for more details.

## 9. Third-Party Links

The App may contain links to third-party websites or services. If you click on those links, third parties may collect or share data about you. We do not control these services and are not responsible for their privacy practices.

## 10. Data Security

We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data:

- End-to-end encryption for images sent to third-party APIs.
- Secure storage for community-shared images.
- Access controls and internal audits.

Please note, no internet transmission is 100% secure, but we do our best to protect your data.

## 11. Children's Privacy

Catzy is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has used the app and shared personal data, please contact us to have it removed.

## 12. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal obligations. When we do, we’ll update the “Last updated” date and notify users through the App. You are encouraged to review this policy periodically.

## 14. California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, you may have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, since we do not collect personal information as defined under CCPA, most provisions may not apply. If you have questions, feel free to contact us.

## 15. International Data Transfers

We may process data using services based outside your country. If data is transferred internationally, we ensure it is done in accordance with applicable laws.
